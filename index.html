          <h2>DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEM IN AFRICA</h2>
          <p>
            In Malindi, Kenya, Asia Bianca and her husband are among the 3,000
            active drug users. Their home contains the tragic reminder of their
            infant daughter's death, marked by her slippers surrounded by
            cigarette waste and drug paraphernalia. Bianca's addiction started
            when her ex-boyfriend secretly laced her cigarettes with heroin, and
            despite her initial unawareness, it has become a significant part of
            her life.

                Africa has become a major player in the global drug market, with
                an increasing presence of international organised crime networks
                and transnational criminal organisations. The continent is also
                facing rising levels of production and trafficking of illicit
                drugs. Over the last decades, heroin has been expanding in many
                regions across the continent as micro trafficking networks
                proliferate. Cocaine, meanwhile, is reasonably new: originally
                transiting the western shores, it has transited through some
                North African countries in the last few years as Andean cocaine
                makes its way to Europe and beyond. However, growing amounts of
                cocaine are now transiting the southern and eastern shores for
                both transshipment and domestic use. Methamphetamine is also
                relatively recent, being produced in Southern Africa since the
                early 1990s, but now also produced in West Africa and used quite
                extensively in Southern and Eastern Africa. This development has
                been driven by economic growth, political instability, weak
                governance structures, and porous borders which have enabled
                easy access to markets for these substances. Additionally,
                poverty leading to an increase in drug use within Africa has
                also exacerbated existing in health, crime, education and
                employment. At the same time, there is a growing amount of use
                of a wide diversity of substances across the continent.
                Nevertheless, the information available on illicit drug use in
                Africa is often based on speculation: there is limited data
                available due to the lack of research conducted in this region.
                This makes it challenging to identify patterns or draw
                conclusions about how widespread these issues are throughout the
                continent. Furthermore, HIV/AIDS is one of the most serious
                public health issues facing Africa. According to the WDR 2022,
                among people who inject drugs in Africa 11 per cent are living
                with HIV, 2020. The cultural taboos surrounding substance abuse
                may prevent individuals from seeking help or reporting their
                experiences with drugs. As a result, much of what we know about
                African drug use comes from anecdotal evidence rather than hard
                facts and figures

                The amotivational syndrome has been described as an effect of
                cannabis abuse. It leads to a poor school performance and the
                adolescent may eventually drop out altogether. The percentage of
                cannabis-associated psychosis has been reported to be between 12
                and 40 per cent of all psychosis in African psychiatric
                hospitals. These findings leave no doubt that the abuse of
                cannabis in African conditions can contribute to the development
                of psychosis in susceptible individuals. Boroffka has observed
                that two types of psychosis may develop in association with
                cannabis abuse: (a) a reaction to the first exposure to cannabis
                abuse in a previously well-integrated personality; and (b)
                escalation of a psychotic process in a personality that has
                already been breaking down (the resort to cannabis is in this
                case a symptom of the incipient psychosis) [ 18]. The
                cannabis-associated psychosis is a schizophrenic-like disorder
                and may be accompanied by a bout of excitement. Certain evidence
                suggests that cannabis use is one of the important contributory
                factors in automobile accidents. It has been reported that
                criminals involved in highway or armed robberies use cannabis
                before committing such criminal acts. The habitual cannabis user
                is usually a drifter, unable to maintain a job or establish a
                continuous relationship with others, especially with members of
                the opposite sex. Amphetamine psychosis, which is usually acute,
                is especially noticeable among students during pre-examination
                period. As khat chewers spend more time chewing khat than
                working, khat abuse affects the productivity of the countries
                involved. Khat users from the lower income group may spend as
                much as half of their daily earnings on khat. The abuse of
                cocaine and heroin is a new and increasing phenomenon in most
                African countries and there is currently no evidence available
                to assess its psycho-social effects. The relationship between
                crime and drug abuse has not been sufficiently studied in
                African countries, and these subject merits the attention of
                future research. There have been reports suggesting that
                adolescents have stolen money from family members to procure the
                drugs of their choice. Reports of stealing outside the family
                and mugging have not been very common. There have been reports
                that the use of cannabis is associated with serious criminal
                behavior, such as armed robbery, reckless driving, assault and
                homicide , but such reports have not been substantiated.

                Correctly identifies lack of access to quality medicines as one
                of the constraints to poor people’s health in Africa. But the
                solutions he recommends—more public money for “essential drugs
                benefits”, building resilient institutions, and providing
                physicians with better scientific information and guidelines
                about drug prescriptions—are unlikely by themselves to improve
                poor people’s health outcomes. More public money. Patricio notes
                that out-of-pocket expenditures are about 40 percent of total
                health expenditures and most of this is spent on outpatient
                drugs. He assumes the reason is that countries have not adopted
                a program of essential drugs benefits, and the reason for the
                latter is lack of public resources. But consider the following
                facts. Money that is currently spent on drugs and other
                materials “leaks” before it gets to the ultimate beneficiary—
                sometimes at alarming rates. In Chad, the leakage rate is 99
                percent. Health workers in public primary clinics in Senegal and
                Tanzania are absent 20 and 21 percent of the time, respectively.
                When present, they spend a total of 39 and 29 minutes a day
                counseling patient. In most countries, when doctors do treat
                patients in public clinics, low competence and low effort
                seriously impede the provision of correct diagnoses and
                treatment. These facts suggest that there are serious problems
                with the way public money is currently being spent. And the
                reasons have to do with incentives. Drugs are worth a lot in the
                open market, and they are easy to steal—which is why poor people
                don’t get them for free. Likewise, doctors are paid regardless
                of whether they show up for work. And when they are at work,
                they give low quality service that encourages patients to go to
                their private clinics, where they are charged. Furthermore, in
                Indonesia, India and Tanzania, there is no correlation between
                measures of structural quality (like the availability of
                medicines) and the quality of medical advice. In such a setting,
                how would allocating more public money for drugs improve poor
                people’s access to quality health care? Building resilient
                institutions. Acknowledging that there are “institutional
                weaknesses in the health system”, Patricio suggests building
                “resilient institutions and systems to facilitate access to and
                promote the rational use of medicines.” Some of the proposals do
                not address the fundamental problem of incentives to deliver
                quality services to the poor. For instance, he cites the use of
                a scratch-off labeling system in Nigeria that reduces the flow
                of counterfeit drugs. That’s fine, but how will this reduce the
                leakage rate? Or absenteeism among doctors? Likewise, giving
                physicians more knowledge and adopting clinical guidelines may
                improve the quality of care, since they don’t seem to be using
                the knowledge they already have. He mentions a pilot project in
                Zambia where district-level planners manage orders and deliver
                drugs more efficiently. But this suggests the problem was lack
                of planning, rather than one of incentives. When the pilot is
                scaled up, what incentives will the district-level planners have
                to deliver drugs efficiently? And why would we favor such a
                system to logistics run by private sector pharmacies (Coca-Cola
                appears in every village in Africa with no problems) combined
                with direct fiscal subsidies to households for drugs? Patricio’s
                example of using Coca-Cola’s distribution system to deliver
                anti-AIDS drugs in Tanzania begins to get to the heart of the
                matter. The reason Coca-Cola has such an efficient supply chain
                is that customers pay for their drinks, so the “providers” have
                an incentive to deliver. Most drugs too are private goods (in
                that the only beneficiary is the patient) but, in our effort to
                make sure poor people get access to them, we provide them for
                free—to everybody. This creates a huge “rent”—the difference
                between the value of the drug and its market price—that is then
                captured by the non-poor—including the people who steal the
                drugs from the clinic and the doctors who are absent. As a
                result, the poor—the very people the policy was intended to
                benefit—lose out.The solution therefore is not to pour more
                money into a leaking bucket—or provide absentee doctors with
                better information—but to empower poor people with the ability
                to hold health workers and drug providers accountable. One way
                would be to charge market prices for drugs but give poor people
                (and only poor people) vouchers or additional cash to buy the
                drugs. And why not do the same for clinical services? The
                details will depend on country circumstances, and such schemes
                will face political resistance from those whose accountability
                is increased, but the simple principle of “money following the
                patient” (rather than the doctor or drug provider) could go a
                long way to improving poor people’s access to drugs. * In 1982,
                two researchers in the Dominican Republic noticed something
                funny going on in the country’s primary health care centers1.
                Not only was the number of daily consultations very low (14), so
                that doctors spent 56 minutes per day seeing patients, but the
                utilization of the clinic was erratic, with 20 consultations
                some weeks and 140 in others. The reason? “According to the
                attending physician, when people knew the monthly supply of
                medicines had arrived, they hastened to the clinic, not in
                search of diagnosis but to request free medicines. In
                conversations with villagers, we found that it was not
                infrequent to given chickens the antibiotics received at the
                clinic.” The researchers went ahead and bravely introduced a
                user-cost for medicines after ensuring that particularly poor
                people were exempt. Subsequently, The number of consultations
                was minimally affected (declines of 5.7%). The fluctuations died
                out and consultations became more even.
